i  have foll following 4 types of file data files are too large so i am gonna give you small pieces of them so you can understand the structure and write a python code to merge all that data into same format so i can use it in my following project "Project Title
Spam Message Classification (Communications)
 
Project Brief
In this project, we’ll build a simple spam-filtering system that can tell apart unwanted (“spam”) text messages from normal (“ham”) ones. We’ll use a public SMS dataset where each message is already labeled as spam or ham. Our goal is to clean up the text, turn it into numbers computers understand, and train a few basic classifiers (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and a simple OneR rule).
Here’s how it will go, step by step:
1.	Data Exploration & Cleaning
o	Load the SMS data and take a quick look at message lengths, most common words, and how many spams vs. hams.
o	Clean the text by lowercasing, removing punctuation, and filtering out tiny “stopwords” like “the” and “and.”
2.	Feature Extraction
o	Convert cleaned messages into a bag-of-words or TF-IDF matrix using scikit-learn.
o	This gives us a numeric table where each row is a message and each column is a word’s frequency or importance score.
3.	Model Training & Comparison
o	Train Naive Bayes (great for text), Decision Tree, and KNN models on a training split.
o	(Optionally) Create a OneR rule by picking the single best word predictor.
o	Evaluate each model on held-out test data using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
4.	Analysis & Reporting
o	Compare which model works best and why.
o	Visualize results with simple charts (word clouds, bar charts of top features, confusion matrices).
o	Discuss challenges faced (e.g., handling very short messages) and possible next steps.
By the end, we’ll have a working spam detector that achieves over 90% accuracy and gives us practical experience in text preprocessing, feature engineering, and basic classification.
